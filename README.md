# NLP-engine-Reseach and Test
## Goal: 
1. Create a streamlit to collect the request information.
2. Reserach the NLP methods to extract string into structure parameters( NLP enigne research)
   
   1)Keyword extraction (e.g NLTK, spaCy)

   (2)Intent classification (transformer-based)

   (3)Embedding and semantic similarity

   (4)LLM prompt engineering ( few-shot examples to JSON output)
4. Scripts:
   1. flan-t5 model:A versatile instruction-tuned transformer model capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks by                        following natural language prompts.
      
   3. valhalla_distibart-mnli model:A lightweight distilled version of BART fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset for efficient                                      and accurate natural language inference.
   4. bert-based-uncased model:A bidirectional transformer trained on masked word prediction and next sentence prediction                                tasks, enabling deep contextual understanding of English text.
