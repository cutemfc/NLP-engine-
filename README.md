# NLP Engine Research and Testing

## Goals
1. Develop a Streamlit application to collect request information.
2. Research NLP methods to extract structured parameters from text:
   1. Keyword extraction (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
   2. Intent classification (transformer-based models)
   3. Embeddings and semantic similarity
   4. LLM prompt engineering (few-shot examples for JSON output)

## Scripts / Models
1. **FLAN-T5 model**: A versatile instruction-tuned transformer capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks by following natural language prompts.
2. **Valhalla DistilBART-MNLI model**: A lightweight distilled version of BART fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset for efficient and accurate natural language inference.
3. **BERT-based uncased model**: A bidirectional transformer trained on masked word prediction, commonly used for feature extraction or fine-tuning on NLP tasks.
